                            	<p style="text-align: left;">The boat ramp is available for the use of all members of the Shore Acres community who acquire a permit.  The cost of a boat ramp permit for members of the Shore Acres Improvement Association is $35.00.  Residents and property owners may purchase a permit even if they are not members of the SAIA, but at a cost of $80.00.  SAIA members who own property that is part of the Lake Placid Waterway Improvement Tax District, and who pay a surcharge on their property taxes that pays for the dredging of the lake and channel, may be issued a boat ramp permit without charge.</br></br>
                              No one has permission to use the boat ramp unless he or she has obtained a permit from the SAIA.  A family need only purchase one permit regardless of the number of boats it owns or uses.  A family is defined as a household, under a single roof, at a single address.  People related by blood or marriage, no matter how close, are not considered family for purposes of membership or boat ramp purposes unless they are part of the same household as just defined.  If two residents own a boat jointly, they need only obtain one key between them.  A permit holder may obtain an additional key at the price of $5.00 â€“ but only provided that it is not to be shared with another family.</br></br>
                              Roat Ramp Keys: The keys are changed every year in early May. To obtain a new key, please send a note to PO Box 12 Arnold MD with a check for $35 (make sure that your community dues are up-to-date). The note should include your address and phone number. You can also contact the following dedicated community volunteers, Cyndy (410-349-0259) or Chris (410-757-4779).</p>
